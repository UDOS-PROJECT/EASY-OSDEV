<h1>ESA S/390(X) Channel SubSystem</h1>

<p>The channel subsystem in the ESA S/390(x) is the system responsible for communication between the devices and the operating system.</p>
<p>One of the most confusing aspects of the CSS is that it uses chains of commands instead of a sequential execution; in short: it uses multiple commands at once instead of only one command at a time (for example, in x86, I/O bound instructions can only output 1 element at a time).</p>
<p>The CSS can be viewed as a DMA device with command chains.</p>
<p>The execution of CSS commands is sequential. The commands are executed in the order they appear.</p>
<p>CSS addresses are real, this means that all addresses are physical and are not bound to the current virtual space.</p>

<h2>CCW Commands</h2>
<p>There are 2 types of CCWs, however CCW0 is only used by SIO/TIO instruction (pre-S390) and CCW1 is used by S390 and above:</p>
<pre>
// Format 0 Control Command Word
struct css_ccw0 {
  uint8_t cmd;
  uint16_t lo_addr;
  uint8_t hi_addr;
  uint8_t flags;
  uint8_t reserved;
  uint16_t count;
} __attribute__((packed));

// Format 1 Control Command Word
struct css_ccw1 {
  uint8_t cmd;
  uint8_t flags;
  uint16_t count;
  uint32_t addr;
} __attribute__((packed));
</pre>

<h2>Types of commands</h2>
<h3>SEEK (0x07)</h3>
<p>Address points to a BBCCHH field (that is, 1 unused halfword, 1 halfword denoting cylinders and another halfword denoting heads). The count should be the size of the BBCCHH (6)</p>
<h3>SEARCH (0x31)</h3>
<p>This will perform a search on the disk (something akin to a seek, but done on the track); Address points to a CCHHR field (that is, 1 halfword denoting cylinders, 1 halfword denoting heads and a character denoting record number). The coount should be the size of the CCHHR (5)</p>
<h3>Transfer In Channel (0x08)</h3>
<p>Jumps to the address field if an error occurs during a SEARCH on the DASD - when the operation is sucessful this command is skipped.</p>
<p>TIC will loop infinitely when SEARCH fails, when the DASD detects that it has read the entire track it will abnormally exit the channel program.</p>
<h3>Read key and Data (0x0E)</h3>
<p>Address is used to point to the destination buffer and length is used to denote the length of data to read.</p>
<h3>Enable (0x27)</h3>
<p>Used mostly by telnet terminals to request them to be enabled (start listening/activate send mode).</p>

<h2>Sample command chain</h2>
<img style="float:left" width="20%" src="s390-ccw.png">

<ul>
<li>Data is coloured blue</li>
<li>Command chain is coloured yellow</li>
<li>Address markers are coloured purple</li>
<li>Green arrows reference the ADDRESS field of the CCW</li>
<li>Blue arrows reference the LENGTH element of the CCW (if such CCW is pointing to the address marker of course)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that HH1 == HH2 and CC1 == CC2. The reason why they are duplicate is to separate the SEEK and SEARCH CCW parameters.</p>
<p>Let's decompose what this chain does:</p>
<ul>
<li>First the SEEK command will seek to the specified cylinder and head (CC1 and HH1)</li>
<li>Then the SEARCH command will search the cylinder, head and record specified in CCHHR</li>
<li>The second SEARCH command purpouse is unknown(?). Presumably to retry the last command operation if it fails</li>
<li>The last and most valuable of all: the LD command, shorthand for Length of Data, describes the length of the read operation - it also holds the buffer to where the read operation shall write to</li>
</ul>

<p>You should be familiar with s390 assembler, if not you can see the <a href="s390-basic.html">introduction</a> page.</p>
<p>Below there is a bunch of code for doing a DASD read operation:</p>

<p>Now what do is basically saving the arguments in the BBCCHHCCHHR data area so the commands can properly use them.</p>
<pre>
# Read a block from the DASD
# r1 = Device number (subchannel id)
# r2 = Head
# r3 = Cylinder
# r4 = Record
# r5 = Buffer
# r6 = Size of buffer
read_block:
    lr %r12, %r15
    lr %r10, %r1                # Save device number in r10
    stcm %r2, 0b0011, rb_cc1    # Cylinder
    stcm %r2, 0b0011, rb_cc2
    stcm %r3, 0b0011, rb_hh1    # Head
    stcm %r3, 0b0011, rb_hh2
    stc %r4, rb_record # Record
    lr %r2, %r5                 # Buffer
    lr %r7, %r6                 # Bytes to read
    st %r2, rb_ldccw + 4        # Overwrite LD.addr to point to our buffer
    sth %r7, rb_ldccw + 2       # And set the size too
</pre>

<p>We are going to save a PSW which will point to rb_count, this means that once an interrupt signaling the success of the read operation occurs, we will jump to rb_count</p>
<pre>
    mvc FLCINPSW(8), rb_newio
    stosm FLCINPSW, 0x00
</pre>

<p>Now we are going to put the first command of the chain into FLCCAW</p>
<pre>
    la %r3, rb_seek
    st %r3, FLCCAW
</pre>

<p>Remember when we stored the device number in r10? Well, all CSS operations in S390 require r1 to be filled with the device number!</p>
<pre>
    lr %r1, %r10
</pre>

<p>IRB must be an area of 24 words, we don't need to initialize it, however we need to consume any pending interrupt before requesting execution</p>
<pre>
    la %r9, rb_irb
    tsch 0(%r9)
    ipm %r11                    # Error checking, if the CC is not zero then an error occoured (see Principles of Operation for error codes)
    srl %r11, 28
    c %r11, %r11
    bnz fatal_error
</pre>

<p>Now, we will request execution of our command chain, ORB must be initialized and point to the first command in the chain</p>
<pre>
    la %r10, rb_orb
    ssch 0(%r10)
    ipm %r11
    srl %r11, 28
    c %r11, %r11
    bnz fatal_error
</pre>

<p>We are now going to wait for a response from the device</p>
<pre>
    lpsw rb_wtnoer
</pre>

<p>When the device answers it will jump to this label, notice that labels in PSWs must be aligned to a word-boundary</p>
<pre>
.align 4
rb_count:
</pre>

<p>Finally, we are going to see if the operation succeded at all</p>
<pre>
    tsch 0(%r9)
    ipm %r11
    srl %r11, 28
    c %r11, %r11
    bnz fatal_error

    sh %r7, 10(%r9)
    lr %r15, %r7
    clc 4(4, %r9), rb_end_chain
    be rb_end
rb_end:
    br %r14
</pre>
