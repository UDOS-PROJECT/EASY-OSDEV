<h1>Virtual Filesystem</h1>

<p>A virtual filesystem is a way to track files on a system. There are various kinds of VFS, including:</p>

<h2>*NIX-style</h2>
<p>A *NIX-style VFS represents every device and every file as a "node" that can have children (folders) or not (files, pipes, etc).</p>
<p>A node can "handle" other nodes (mount points), the system needs to keep track of which nodes are mounted by which.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
/dev/mnt0 (Loopback mountpoint, associated to /dev/file.txt)
	-> /media/mount/test
	-> /media/mount/abc
	-> /media/mount/folder
		-> /media/mount/folder/sys
</pre>
<p>In this case writes and reads to /dev/mnt0 are mapped to the file /dev/file.txt</p>

<h2>DOS-style</h2>
<p>Instead of having mounts anywhere, we have drive letters, where every drive letter is a mountpoint with a driver.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
C:\ (mountpoint by NVMe driver)
	-> C:\some\file
	-> C:\file.txt

D:\ (loopback)
	-> D:\test.txt
</pre>
