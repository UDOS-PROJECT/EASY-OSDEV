<h1>Multitasking</h1>
<p>TODO: Explain more in-depth</p>

<h2>Processes vs. Threads</h2>
<p>In short: A process is an abstract type of a task that has it's own address space, while a thread has their own registers and stack.</p>

<h2>Context Switches</h2>
<p>A context switch is done when all registers are loaded from storage (the state) into the current registers, this also includes switching address spaces (if paging is used) by pointing to a new root page table, which can be or not saved in the state along with the registers.</p>
<p>In some architectures extra space is required to save the state of vector registers, for example in x86, the SSE instructions uses about 256-bytes to save the vector registers on a state.</p>
<p>Context switches are costly; however running 1 process while it's doing nothing for a prolonged time may result to be a very bad latency. Various algorithms exist for this task:</p>

<h3>Round robin scheduling</h3>
<p>Basic form of scheduling, go to next process and when we are at the tail process we go back to the head.</p>

<h3>*NIX scheduling</h3>
<p>So we are going to punish processes who use more CPU time!</p>

<h3>Priority scheduling</h3>
<p>Some processes have more priority than others, processes with similar priority can be handled by an algorithm to sort them.</p>
