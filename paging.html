<h1>Paging</h1>
<p>Paging; famously known as the hardest challenge for a newbie OSDever.</p>
<p>TODO: Explain more in-depth</p>

<h2>Virtual to Physical translation</h2>

<img style="float:left;width:20%" src="virt2phys.png"><br>

<section style="float:left;width:80%">
<p>(On the left, our theorical CPU, with a nice MMU mapping 0x2000 physical address to 0x3000)</p>
<p>The virtual to physical translation happens at your leafs (that is, the lowest page table levels), the virtual address is determined by the offest of the page.</p>

<p>In this example we will assume a 2-level paging, and 4KB pages, with the level 1 being the leaf pages:</p>
<b>Leaf page</b>
<ul>
<li>Bytes per Page = 4096</li>
</ul>

<b>Page table</b>
<ul>
<li>Number of Entries = 1024 entries</li>
<li>Bytes per Entry = (Bytes per Page * Number of Entries) = 4194304 bytes</li>
</ul>

<p>So - to recapitulate, this would be the code to represent the pages and their memory:</p>
<pre>
#define PAGE_ENTRIES 1024
#define PAGE_SIZE 4096

/* 1024 32-bit entries, a page table size is 4096, so 4096 / 4 = 1024 */
typedef uint32_t page_t;

/* The page table itself containing 1024 page entries */
page_t PageTable[PAGE_ENTRIES];

/* How the virtual memory could be laid out according to the page table */
unsigned char Memory[PAGE_ENTRIES][PAGE_SIZE];

/* Page 1 - Offset 0 */
Memory[0x01][0x00] = 0;

/* Page 3 - Offset 0x20 */
Memory[0x03][0x20] = 0;

/* Etcetera... */
</pre>

<p>On most sane architectures the order of the entries on a page table is sequential.</p>

<p>If we mapped page 1 to 0x4000, every write done to Memory[0x00][Offset] would reflect on 0x4000 + Offset, but not on 0x0000 + Offset - this is because a page can only contain a physical address, an access to a virtual address cannot be handled by multiple entries - if the architecture is sane of course.</p>

<h2>Virtual Space</h2>
<p>The page table and the parts that it maps is known as the <b>Virtual Space</b> or <b>Address Space</b>.</p>
<p>On modern operating systems an unique virtual space is given to each program, the address space contains ELF files, libraries and other dependencies the program may have.</p>

<h3>1 library = 10 virtual libraries</h3>
<p>In order to save space, the operating system can load a library on a physical location, then map it along the programs that use it as if the library was "loaded" along the program. This works well except when libraries depend on global states.</p>

<h3>Page colouring</h3>
<p>In some architectures, the top bits of a virtual address are taken by the cache to cache the latest used page per X pages. You can use this technique to put high-priority pages into an address that is aligned to the cache's requirements, normally 255 coloured pages can exist in a system.</p>

<h3>Swap</h3>
<p>Swap consists in accessing non-existant pages (by reporting them as being available to the application), trapping the accesses and then swapping the data to the disk - this takes a lot of time to do and creates something called overcommitment, where the system may run out of RAM and the disk may be used for extra memory.</p>

<h3>Context Switches</h3>
<p>Optimizations to context switches is describes in <a href="multitasking.html">multitasking</a>.</p>
